# CryptoPals

This is my (GGbits) solutions to the CryptoPal challenges created over at http://cryptopals.com/

All scripts are created (currently) in python 3.5. This scripts have been created for education purposes to challenge myself and to better learn cryptography and python. All scripts come as is and are not garenteed to work or produce the correct answers. As always, these scripts ARE NOT to be used for any malicous activities, so please play nicely.

Have Fun,
#GGBits
